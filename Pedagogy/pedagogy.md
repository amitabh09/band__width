1.
  1. 1 FOCUS AREA:

The student will know the concept of energy band gap and relation for finding slope Of  graph of log(Is)  vs  1000/T. This experiment is based  on formula of band gap. Finally analysing the results with standard values.

1.2 About the Experiment:

This experiment is to let one learn how is energy band gap of semiconductor is calculated.

**1.3 Learning Objectives:** (write in the table below)

Write Learning Objectives that can be achieved using virtual labs and the respective cognitive level, &amp; action verbs.

| **S.No.** | **Learning Objective** | **Cognitive Level** | **Action Verb** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Users will be able to identify instruments used in experiment : Energy band gap in semiconductor | recall | identify |
| 2 | User will be able to define band width ,temperature and saturation current | recall | define |
| 3 | User will be able to describe band width is dependent on saturation current and temperature | understand | describe |
| 4 | User willbe able to examine band width and graph of log of Is vs 000/T | analyze | examine |

( you can add more rows. )

**2. Instructional Strategy**

Instructional stratergy will be implemented in the simulator as follows :

Student will identify the various components as per the arrangements to construct the setup . With this tey will get concept and purpose of each components . They set the voltage ,current and temperature to respective values bin simulator . On clicking calculate they get in return the values of slope and band width

**Enter value of voltage, temperature and saturation current and you get bandwidth**

**2.**** 1 **** Assessment Method:**

**The values are assesed by the formula and test  questions**

**3. Task &amp; Assessment Questions**

Complete the following table with details of the various tasks and assessment questions you will give to the students.

| **SrNo.** | **Learning Objective to be met** (choose anyone from you declared above) | **Tasks to be performed by the students** | **Assessment questions aligned to the task** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | Band width in semiconductor is 0 to 2eV | **Run the simulator giving inputs** | **W**** hat is energy band gap in semiconductor** |
| **2** | Slope and band width | Plot graph of  log(i) vs log(t) | what  is graph of   log(i) vs log(t) |

( you can add more rows. Assessment Questions to all the Learning Objective should be met. )

**4. Simulator Interactions**

**Complete the following table giving the details of the Simulator interactions.**

What Simulator will do? What students will do? Purpose of the task

Write your content in the table below.

Complete the following table with details of the various tasks and assessment questions you will give to the students.

| **SrNo.** | Whar student will do | **What simulator will do** | **Purpose of task** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | Student will click on simulator tab | **Simulator opens the experiment screen and student fill any number to enter the simulator** | **To open the screen to perform experiment** |
| **2** | Student will enter current ,temperture  and voltage to run the simulator and press calculate | **Simulator will return the value of      band width  and slope** | To let student receive answers from simulator so that he feels it like reality |
