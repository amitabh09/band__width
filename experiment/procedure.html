<h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
<pre><h3 style="font-size:23;"><i>
1.Connect the circuit as shown in fig.1 ie. positive of 0-20 V power supply to N-side of diode and to
  positive of voltmeter. Connect negative of power supply to negative of and negative of micro ammeter
  (4A) and positive of micro ammeter to P-side of diode. 
2. Keep the temperature control knob fully 
   anti-clockwise. 
3. Switch on the instrument using on/off toggle switch provided temperature control 
   knob fully anticlockwise 
4. Adjust the voltage at 2.5V DC and note down the reverse current 
5. Adjust the temperature control knob at maximum position. Temperature starts increasing and the 
   reading of the micro ammeter starts increasing 
6. When temperature reaches to 800C or 1000C, switch
   off the oven by rotating the pot anticlockwise down to minimun side. Note down the maximum reading 
   shown by micro on front panel keeping ammeter. 
7. As the temperature starts falling, record the values
   of micro ammeter reading in observation table after every 50C drop in temperature 
8. Repeat the whole
   procedure for 5VDC and 7.5V DC 
9. Plot a graph between 10 /T along x axis and logiol along y axis, and the slope of the line is 
   determined from the graph.
