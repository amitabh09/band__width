**Round 2**

**1. Aim and Objective**

To determine energy band gap of a semiconductor.



2. Theory

We know in the case of insulators, the region between highest level of completely filled band

(called valence band) and the lowest level of allowed empty band (called conduction band) is

very wide This is called energy gap, denoted by E g and is about 3 to 7 eV (electron volt) in

case of insulators In case of semiconductors, this energy gap is quite small. For example, in

case of manium, E g-0,7 eV and in case of silicon E g -1.1 eV. In semiconductors at low

temperatures, there are few charges to move so conductivity is quite low. At higher temperatures

the donor or acceptor levels come in to action and provide carriers and hence the conduction

rises.

In addition to the dependence of the electrical conductivity on the number of free charges, it

also depends on their mobility. However, mobility of the charge carriers somewhat decrease with

increasing temperature but on the average the conductivity of the semiconductors rises with

increasing temperature To determine the energy gap of a semi-conducting material, we study the

ariation of its conductance with temperature. In reverse bias, the currents flowing through the

jusction are quite small and internal heating of the junction does not take place.

**3**  **Procedure**

1.Connect the circuit as shown in fig.1 ie. positive of 0-20 V power supply to N-side of diode and to

  positive of voltmeter. Connect negative of power supply to negative of and negative of micro ammeter

  (4A) and positive of micro ammeter to P-side of diode.

2. Keep the temperature control knob fully

   anti-clockwise.

3. Switch on the instrument using on/off toggle switch provided temperature control

   knob fully anticlockwise

4. Adjust the voltage at 2.5V DC and note down the reverse current

5. Adjust the temperature control knob at maximum position. Temperature starts increasing and the

   reading of the micro ammeter starts increasing

6. When temperature reaches to 800C or 1000C, switch

   off the oven by rotating the pot anticlockwise down to minimun side. Note down the maximum reading

   shown by micro on front panel keeping ammeter.

7. As the temperature starts falling, record the values

   of micro ammeter reading in observation table after every 50C drop in temperature

8. Repeat the whole

   procedure for 5VDC and 7.5V DC

9. Plot a graph between 10 /T along x axis and logiol along y axis, and the slope of the line is

   determined from the graph.
