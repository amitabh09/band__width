Round 2

1. Story Outline:

The energy required by the electrons to move from a lower energy ban to a higher energy band is called energy gap.

For conductor, the energy gap is low and so, the external energy required to push the electrons to valance band (the outer most band) is very low.

For semi - conductor, the energy gap is medium and a considerable amount of energy is required to pump the electrons to the valance band. To convert semi - conductor into conductor, impurities are added and the process is called doping. for example, Germanium in added with silicon to make silicon a conductor.

For insulators, the energy gap is large and it is not possible by supplying them any external energy to make them conductor.

2. Story:

2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:

The name semiconductor comes from the fact that these materials  have an electrical conductivity between that of a metal, like copper, gold, etc. and an insulator, such as glass. They have an energy gap less than 4eV (about 1eV). In solid-state physics, this energy gap or band gap is an energy range between valence band and conduction band where electron states are forbidden. Properties of semiconductors are determined by the energy gap between valence and conduction bands.



2.2 Set User Objectives &amp; Goals:

1 The prime objective of experiment is to let user learn how to calculate the energy band gap in a semiconductor

2 To identify the apparatus of experiment

3 To define saturation current and band width of semiconductor

4 To explain the relation between saturation current , temperature and energy band gap and be able to plot the graph .

5 User is  able to plot the graph between log of sturation current vs 1000/T

6 Attemp the pre test .

7Attemp the post test .

2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1 Click on  simulator or open the simulator page to start the simulator .

2 All component of the experimental setup are visible on the screen

3 This screen has the complete experimental setup and shows the button to calculate .

4 Voltmeter , thermometer and ammeter are visible on the screen press onto the to input the values and give them command as directed under the box .

5 Observation table which is also a simulator returns the calculated value of components under it with 2 or 3 inputs .

6 Next screen has plotted graph whuch lets user know the nature of slope .

7 Results are displayed on the same screen .



2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Formative assesment questions

Pre Test

Difficulty level: Recall

What is value of voltage in calculating band width?

A Constant

B Variable

C No Change

D 0V

2 At higher tempertaure how is conduction in semiconductor affected?

A Constant

B Increases

C Decreases

D No change

2.5 Allow pitfalls:

This pitfall does not mean wrong answer and retrying . It is designed to clear misconceptions or incorrect knowledge .

2.6 Conclusion:

Time taken by the student to attempt the questions :\_\_\_\_

The student correctly answered :---1/4

At the completion of this experiment following are the interpretations

A B C .

There are 6 questions with different difficulty levels . Assesment of multiple choice questions will be given immedeately to the students . Student select correct answer by clicking on them and gets correct answer at last of the screen .The approximate time required to understand the complete procedure and perform experiment is about 5 mins. Calulating and entering the values will require approximately 10 mins.

And the total experiment will take 30 mins.
